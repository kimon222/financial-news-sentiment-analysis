## Technologies Used:
- **NLP with VADER**: Sentiment analysis of financial headlines.
- **Python libraries**: pandas, nltk, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
  
## Details:
- I applied **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to classify financial news headlines.
- The sentiment was classified into **Bullish** or **Bearish**, based on the sentiment score.

***Explanation***:
- Top Left (TN): True Negative ‚Äî The model predicted Bearish when the actual sentiment was Bearish.
- Top Right (FP): False Positive ‚Äî The model predicted Bullish when the actual sentiment was Bearish.
- Bottom Left (FN): False Negative ‚Äî The model predicted Bearish when the actual sentiment was Bullish.
- Bottom Right (TN): True Positive ‚Äî The model predicted Bullish when the actual sentiment was Bullish.

***Random Forest Explanation***:
Random Forest can be visualized as as a team of experts (decision trees). Each expert looks at the same information (the headlines) and makes their own prediction. Then, they all come together and "vote" on the final result. This makes the prediction much more reliable than just one person's opinion (one decision tree).
