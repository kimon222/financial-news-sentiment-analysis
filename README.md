# Financial News Sentiment Analysis

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify financial news headlines as **bullish** or **bearish** for stock movement predictions.

## What I Used:
- **NLP with VADER**: Sentiment analysis of financial headlines.
- **Python libraries**: pandas, nltk, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
  
## How It Works:
- I applied **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to classify financial news headlines.
- The sentiment was classified into **Bullish** or **Bearish**, based on the sentiment score.

### Link to Kaggle Project:
